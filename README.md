# Neurocognitive Analysis of Schizoaffective Disorder

This project focuses on analyzing neurocognitive measures to explore the differences in cognitive performance between individuals diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder and a control group. The aim is to identify specific cognitive domains that exhibit significant associations with the diagnosis, potentially serving as cognitive biomarkers for the disorder.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is titled "Neurocognitive Measures in Psychiatric Groups," obtained from [source link](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html). It consists of neurocognitive measures, clinical diagnoses, and demographic information of individuals with Schizoaffective disorder and a control group. The dataset comprises 242 observations, providing a robust sample size for statistical analyses.

## Hypotheses

1. Hypothesis 1: Individuals diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder will demonstrate significantly different neurocognitive performance compared to the control group.

2. Hypothesis 2: Specific neurocognitive measures will show significant associations with the diagnosis of Schizoaffective disorder, indicating potential cognitive biomarkers for the disorder.

## Files

- `neurocognitive_analysis_schizoaffective.py`: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neurocognitive-analysis-schizoaffective.git


2. Install the required dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Modify the script as needed, such as updating file paths or adjusting analysis parameters.

4. Run the script:

## Results

The results of the neurocognitive analysis will be presented in the research paper, providing insights into the differences in neurocognitive performance between individuals with Schizoaffective disorder and the control group. The findings may shed light on the cognitive profiles associated with the disorder and identify potential cognitive biomarkers.
